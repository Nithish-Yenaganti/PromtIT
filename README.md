# Prompt Normalizer (IDE)

Prompt Normalizer is a VS Code / Cursor extension that converts unstructured developer tasks into clean, structured prompts before sending them to AI coding agents.

## What it does

- Takes messy developer input (bug notes, tasks, security checks)
- Compiles it into a structured, system-style prompt
- Does not guess missing information
- Runs fully locally (no API calls)

## How to use

1. Select any text in the editor
2. Run: **Prompt Normalizer: Compile Prompt**
3. The text is rewritten into a structured prompt
4. Send it to your AI agent (Cursor, Copilot-style tools)

## Profiles

- SWE – General coding tasks
- Bugfix – Debugging and fixes
- Security – Code and security review

## Notes

- No assumptions are made
- Missing information is explicitly listed
- Designed to improve agent reliability, not replace agents
